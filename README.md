# Assignment 2: Eyang's Magic Teas

## About
I just finished reading a book, "a Magic Steeped in Poison" where tea is used as a form of enacting magic. I was inspired by that book to create a e-commerce website selling magic teas that have spiritual properties to help you manifest your goals. I decided to call it "Eyang's Magic Teas," as "Eyang" means grandmother in my language.

## Tech Stack
Beyond React and Redux, I also used Vite for the development environment, as it is more modern and much more stable than using React and Redux by itself.

## Extra Feature
I implimented payment capability using Stripe API via React.
